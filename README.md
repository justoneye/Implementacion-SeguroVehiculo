## Evaluation Items

- Validation in all fields of the form.
- Communication between parent and child.
- Show one, two, three or no cards depending on the data entered in the form, complying with the proposed rules.
- Mathematical operations.
- Styles of the site.
- The site must be responsive, it is necessary to be able to view it without problem on all devices.
- Code organization.
- HTML5 (Html, CSS, Javascript) should be used for development.

## EXTRA QUESTIONS
#### 1. Suggest a backend architecture you would use for the theme.
_R/:_
<div align="center">
    <img src="Architecture.drawio.png" width="45%"/>
</div>
<br /><br />

#### 2. Evaluate if what you propose is the most efficient, or if it seems to you that there are ways easier to deploy.
_R/: Any algorithm is susceptible to being changed and optimized, in this case, it would have proposed to create the insurance card information in a JSON file along with the characteristics, variables and percentages to make the calculations for each offer. In addition to creating a better user interface, using a framework to manage states and calculate offers in parallel with filling out the form._
<br /><br />

#### 3. What AI tools would you use to improve code performance?
_R/: Along with GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, add tools that suggest code optimizations, bug fixes, code minification, and optimization with multimedia content._
